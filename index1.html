<h4>" I - Never trap thy unicorn or the sin of the evil seed will germinate in ye body. Remember if ye uses thy brain, use it for loaf and yeast sake.
 II - A Loaf shall be toasted if thy are not true with butter and such condiments. A Toast is a sin to the Loaves and thus traps thy unicorns. III -The Half Loaf has come twice now. The third time shall cause Mr. Gordon Freebread to be flung into the pit of head crabs. Praise the Almighty Loaf. IV - If the Almighty Loaf is not pleased with his sacrifices, then the bell shall strike. As the striking of the bell begins so does the yodelling. As the yodelling continues, the Chief of Donut Repair will come with his beings of dough and thy will strike ye who has not pleased The Almighty Loaf.” — -Sheldor-'s Commandments - The Almighty Loaf</h4>

<h4>If one wants to convert themselves into a practitioner of Loafism they must accept his role as master of the universe, admit the superiority of all yeast based products and offer their soul to the loaf. After that one must kill a fellow human with a butter knife and spread the victims blood on a piece of bread with said butterknife. Finally you must toast the bread and consume it, offering you acceptance into the religion.</h4>
<h5>If you seek to know more about our lord and savior you may view the holy scriptures of the book of loaf.</h5>

<h4>The Almighty Loaf is a whole grain deity originating from the 6th rack of the oven(Hell for all you non-believers). He goes by many names such as, the almighty, the master, and loaf bloke. He is incapable of death and has complete control over every object and being. When you die if the loaf sees you've led a grain filled life you shall live for eternity in the rye fields free to do as you wish. If you are a non-believer you will be sentenced to the oven till the end of time. One can get closer to the loaf by eating bread buttering and toasting bread.</h4>
