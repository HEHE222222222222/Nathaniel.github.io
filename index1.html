<h2>The 4 Commandments</h2>
<h4>" I - Never trap thy unicorn or the sin of the evil seed will germinate in ye body. Remember if ye uses thy brain, use it for loaf and yeast sake.
 II - A Loaf shall be toasted if thy are not true with butter and such condiments. A Toast is a sin to the Loaves and thus traps thy unicorns. III -The Half Loaf has come twice now. The third time shall cause Mr. Gordon Freebread to be flung into the pit of head crabs. Praise the Almighty Loaf. IV - If the Almighty Loaf is not please with his sacrifices, then the bell shall strike. As the striking of the bell begins so does the yodelling. As the yodelling continues, the Chief of Donut Repair will come with his beings of dough and thy will strike ye who has not pleased The Almighty Loaf.” — -Sheldor-'s Commandments - The Almighty Loaf</h4>
